An extremely basic script that creates users, puts them in an OU and security group than gives them share folders along with a roaming profile.

Right now the script requires very minor input from the user but once that's done it should be good to go on a specific machine.

Possible to-do list?

- Make Silent (Perhaps an echo "$Name Created" at the end?)
- Fully automate.  

But all this was to me was a learning experience so I'm happy.
