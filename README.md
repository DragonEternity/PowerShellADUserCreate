An extremely basic script that creates users, puts them in an OU and security group than gives them share folders along with a roaming profile.

Possible to-do list?

- Make Silent (Perhaps an echo "$Name Created" at the end?)
- Fully automate. Right now this script requires some manual input but only once. 

But all this was to me was a learning experience so I'm happy.
